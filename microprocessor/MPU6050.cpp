/** Get 3-axis accelerometer readings.
 * These registers store the most recent accelerometer measurements.
 * Accelerometer measurements are written to these registers at the Sample Rate
 * as defined in Register 25.
 *
 * The accelerometer measurement registers, along with the temperature
 * measurement registers, gyroscope measurement registers, and external sensor
 * data registers, are composed of two sets of registers: an internal register
 * set and a user-facing read register set.
 *
 * The data within the accelerometer sensors' internal register set is always
 * updated at the Sample Rate. Meanwhile, the user-facing read register set
 * duplicates the internal register set's data values whenever the serial
 * interface is idle. This guarantees that a burst read of sensor registers will
 * read measurements from the same sampling instant. Note that if burst reads
 * are not used, the user is responsible for ensuring a set of single byte reads
 * correspond to a single sampling instant by checking the Data Ready interrupt.
 *
 * Each 16-bit accelerometer measurement has a full scale defined in ACCEL_FS
 * (Register 28). For each full scale setting, the accelerometers' sensitivity
 * per LSB in ACCEL_xOUT is shown in the table below:
 *
 * <pre>
 * AFS_SEL | Full Scale Range | LSB Sensitivity
 * --------+------------------+----------------
 * 0       | +/- 2g           | 8192 LSB/mg
 * 1       | +/- 4g           | 4096 LSB/mg
 * 2       | +/- 8g           | 2048 LSB/mg
 * 3       | +/- 16g          | 1024 LSB/mg
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param x 16-bit signed integer container for X-axis acceleration
 * @param y 16-bit signed integer container for Y-axis acceleration
 * @param z 16-bit signed integer container for Z-axis acceleration
 * @see MPU6050_RA_GYRO_XOUT_H

/** Set clock source setting.
 * An internal 8MHz oscillator, gyroscope based clock, or external sources can
 * be selected as the MPU-60X0 clock source. When the internal 8 MHz oscillator
 * or an external source is chosen as the clock source, the MPU-60X0 can operate
 * in low power modes with the gyroscopes disabled.
 *
 * Upon power up, the MPU-60X0 clock source defaults to the internal oscillator.
 * However, it is highly recommended that the device be configured to use one of
 * the gyroscopes (or an external clock source) as the clock reference for
 * improved stability. The clock source can be selected according to the following table:
 *
 * <pre>
 * CLK_SEL | Clock Source
 * --------+--------------------------------------
 * 0       | Internal oscillator
 * 1       | PLL with X Gyro reference
 * 2       | PLL with Y Gyro reference
 * 3       | PLL with Z Gyro reference
 * 4       | PLL with external 32.768kHz reference
 * 5       | PLL with external 19.2MHz reference
 * 6       | Reserved
 * 7       | Stops the clock and keeps the timing generator in reset
